The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is Australia's only [community justice](http://www.neighbourhoodjustice.vic.gov.au/home/about+us/community+justice/) centre, servicing the [City of Yarra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Yarra) since 2007 with a focus on addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour and addressing social inequality.

City of Yarra is small, but very dense with a mix of people from a vast array of cultural, economic and social backgrounds.

Some of the key services the NJC provides include:
* Functioning as the Magistrate Court for City of Yarra
* A Client-centred approach to access to social services
* A space for community groups to meet

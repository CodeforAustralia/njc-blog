## Pain points
During my time at the NJC some recurring themes, gripes and pain points started to emerge from my conversations with staff, my time spent observing staff on the job and through interactions with clients and the wider community. The main themes that emerged were around:
* Supporting client participation in the justice process, better equipping clients with the information they need about their matters
* Finding ways for staff working across vastly different areas with different schedules to stay in communication
* Telling the NJC story and sharing how the NJC community justice model operates

### Client participation

One of the key foundations of the NJC is it's integrated service model, local community services are contracted to provide staff onsite at the NJC, providing a single point of access to a wide range of community service and allowing them to assess the needs of each case taking into account all contributing factors and refer their clients to relevant services within the NJC and outside where needed.

In cases where the client is accused of committing a crime, this approach allows the NJC to schedule pre-sentencing activities, providing an opportunity to start addressing the circumstances of their situation and to put steps in place to move forward. These activities can later be presented to the Magistrate to help paint a thorough picture of the case, often leading to better outcomes for the parties involved and the community.

The key challenge is motivating and supporting the clients to attend these activities, clients often miss appointments for a myriad of reasons, sometimes without understanding the benefits of these activities. At the same time, the current systems employed by the Magistrates courts don't provide a lot of options to stay in touch with clients in between court dates.

### Other challenges
Some other key pain points highlighted were:
* The difficulty in capturing all the interactions and conversations with clients that occur on a day to day basis
* Double handling of information, re-keying between systems, printing / faxing to send to clients or to external agencies
* Multiple systems often with confusing and hard to use interfaces
* The external perceptions of the NJC as simply being a 'Rolls Royce' model of justice
* Staying in touch with what is happening across staff with vastly different schedules
* Lots and lots of emails

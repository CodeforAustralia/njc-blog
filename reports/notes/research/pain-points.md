# Pain points
Some of the interesting pain points, areas of frustration and general observations I came across during my shadowing and research included:
* Staff needing to re-key information between systems
* Clunky systems with painful and confusing interfaces
* The difficulty of capturing all the work that is done in the current tools being used
* Ensuring clients attended scheduled appointments and court dates
* Sometimes the work of the NJC can be dismissed as simply being a "Rolls Royce" model of justice
* Too many emails

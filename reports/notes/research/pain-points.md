## Pain points
During my time at the NJC some recurring themes, gripes and pain points started to emerge from my conversations with staff, my time spent observing staff on the job and through interactions with clients and the wider community. The main themes that emerged were around supporting client participation in the justice process and telling the NJC story and sharing the NJC community justice model.

### Client participation

One of the key foundations of the NJC is it's integrated service model, local community services are contracted to provide staff onsite at the NJC, providing a single point of access to a wide range of community service and allowing them to assess the needs of each case taking into account all contributing factors and refer their clients to relevant services within the NJC and outside where needed.

This approach allows the NJC to schedule pre-sentencing activities for their clients, providing them the opportunity to start addressing the circumstances of their situation and to put steps in place to move forward. These activities can later be presented to the Magistrate to help paint a thorough picture of the case, often leading to better outcomes for the parties involved and the community.

The key challenge is motivating and supporting the clients to attend these activities, clients often miss appointments for a myriad of reasons, sometimes without understanding the benefits of these activities. At the same time, the current systems employed by the Magistrates courts don't provide a lot of options.

Some other common pain points were:
* The difficulty in capturing all the interactions and conversations with clients that occur on a day to day basis
* Double handling of information, re-keying between systems, printing / faxing to send to clients or to external agencies
* Multiple systems often with confusing and hard to use interfaces
* The external perceptions of the NJC as simply being a "Rolls Royce" model of justice
* Staying in touch with what is happening
* Too many emails

## Opportunities
For the rest of my fellowship I will be focusing on a few key areas to build some prototypes and start testing with the community. One of the biggest opportunities seems to be around how Magistrates courts could go about providing clients with clear, timely access to information about their matter. Currently in most instances clients are provided with printouts on the spot, or mailed information related to their matter.

For the NJC this can be in regards to pre-sentencing appointments, court dates or simply access to outcomes such as intervention orders. Giving clients access to this information will help support them through their interactions with the Justice system, provide them with clarity of where their matter is at and help when they need to re-tell their story or recount previous events.

I will also be prototyping some ideas around how we can strengthen the

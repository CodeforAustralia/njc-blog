## Learnings
Some of the goals the NJC is committed to include tackling social disadvantage, addressing the underlying causes of crime and increasing access and confidence in the Justice system for members of the community.

I had the opportunity to learn about how the NJC applies these concepts in the City of Yarra, some of the key things I learnt about included:

* How the NJC builds and strengthens existing relationships with disparate stakeholders in the community
* The strength of the integrated service delivery model in providing constant dialogue between community services
* The NJC utilising it's unique context to trial and test innovations that might not be obvious in other courts
* Understanding how the NJC staff bring their wide range of skills, knowledge and expertise to focus on providing better outcomes for clients
* Understanding how addressing the underlying causes of criminal behaviour can be a vital step in preventing re-offending
* Learning about the court's role in delivering Community Justice
* The experiences of community members living in public housing
* The opportunities that a community justice model provides for real world, locally focused solutions
* How the NJC looks to equip the community with the skills and tools for problem solving

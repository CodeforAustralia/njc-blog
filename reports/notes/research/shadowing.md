## What have i done
I have spent ~ hours over ~ days at the NJC, this has been a mixture of shadowing staff in their various roles, mapping, reading, listening, hearing and documenting whatever I can about the background and the context the NJC operates in, sitting in on various community events and networks and getting involved.

Before I started, some of my goals for this research stage were to:
* Gain a deep understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand who makes up the NJC's community, how, why and when they interact with the NJC
* Capture possible opportunities that we could prototype solutions in

I have met with ~..... NJC staff
I have also had the chance to observe the NJC in the context of our community through....

I have had ~ meetings, consumed ~ cups of coffee (% of which were instant) attended ~ events where I have had the opportunity to articulate the strengths of a community justice model and why I believe in working with the NJC

## What are some opportunities
Through my research, discussions with staff members and learning more about the City of Yarra, I came across some other areas I thought were opportunities for the NJC to innovate through technical or:
* Providing a platform to connect local like-minded people and companies with real world issues and communities
* Increasing the ability of the NJC to be at the centre of leading edge justice
* Sharing successes and small wins, talking about the day to day changes and impact the NJC is having in the lives of the community
* Growing the NJC as an education leader in client-centred justice

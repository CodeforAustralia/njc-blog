# Stakeholder engagement report back
## What have i done
I have spent ~ hours over ~ days at the NJC, this has been a mixture of shadowing staff in their various roles, mapping, reading, listening, hearing and documenting whatever I can about the background and the context the NJC operates in, sitting in on various community events and networks.

[//]: # "My aim was to understand who the NJC works with, how they support the community, current practices and areas that could be enhanced."

My overarching goals through this process have been to:
* Gain a deep understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand the NJC's community, as well as how, why and when they interact with the NJC
[//]: # "* Engage with staff, to"
* Capture possible opportunities that we could prototype solutions in

I have met with ~..... NJC staff
I have also had the chance to observe the NJC in the context of our community through....

I have had ~ meetings, consumed ~ cups of coffee (% of which were instant) attended ~ events where I have had the opportunity to articulate the strengths of a community justice model and why I believe in working with the NJC

## What did I learn
Some of the goals the NJC is committed include tackling social disadvantage, addressing the underlying causes of crime and increasing access and confidence in the Justice system for members of the community.

I had the opportunity to learn about how the NJC applies these concepts to the City of Yarra, some of the key things I learnt about included:

* First hand experience how the NJC builds and strengthens relationships with disparate stakeholders in the community
* How the NJC looks to strengthen the community with skills and tools for problem solving
* The NJC utilising it's unique context to trial and test innovations that might not be obvious in other courts
* Understanding how the NJC staff bring their wide range of skills, knowledge and expertise to provide better outcomes for clients
* Understanding how addressing the underlying causes of criminal behaviour can be a vital step in preventing re-offending
* Learning about the court's role in delivering Community Justice
* The experiences of community members living in public housing
* The opportunities that a community justice model provides for real world locally focused solutions

[//]: # "## What has surprised me?"
[//]: # "Staff have been eager to help me get involved in the work they do, allowing me to have a deeper and clearer insight into how community justice is lived out in the City of Yarra."

[//]: # "I have also been surprised by the "

[//]: # "One of the most surprising things I've found in my shadowing, has been the level of comfort, ease and trust that exists between the NJC staff, your clients and your community. The strength of the relationships that the NJC has forged not only with the community but with"

[//]: # "I've been wonderfully surprised at the openness, honesty and genuine intrigue I have experienced through my shadowing experience. Staff have been eager to involve me in the work they do, allowing me to have a deeper and clearer insight into exactly how the NJC functions."

[//]: # "* Misconceptions about community justice"
[//]: # "* Why is this model not everywhere?"

## What can we look at
Some areas I think we can look into and possibly utilise technology include:
* Working around the constraints of the core systems, particularly court-link
* Providing clients with greater agency and options for accessing information related to their case
* Finding opportunities to share some of the experiences and knowledge of the NJC staff and community

[//]: # "### Areas to prototype"

## What are some opportunities
* Growing the NJC as an education leader in client-centred justice
* Providing a platform to connect local like-minded people and companies with real world issues and communities
* Increasing the ability of the NJC to be at the centre of leading edge justice
[//]: # "* Continually sharing learnings from good and bad experiences"
* Sharing successes and small wins, talking about the day to day changes and impact the NJC is having in the lives of the community



[//]: # "* Modelling how courts can provide client focussed services"

* Taking time to reflect and assess what you are doing..
* Taking on the role of leaders in innovative justice and transferring that knowledge into other courts
* Bringing togethor the community, tech sector and businesses to innovate around localised issues
* Something about multilingual access to court?

## How do you want me to continue the conversation?
* Point out some options for ongoing communication, put it to staff to ask what will work for them.
  * Weekly lunchtime updates?
  * Email?
  * Updating a website?
  * Combination?

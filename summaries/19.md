## What worked
### General
* STAR WARS - THE FORCE AWAKENS!!!! OMG
* I'm moving away from the ideas of the comms dash, i think it would spiral and overlap too much with ideas that could be implemented via slack already.
  - had a good chat with jake and i think the solution would be to just set something up and run with it, jith & peter gave some good insight on their experiences with slack and possible pitfalls to avoid early on.
  - set up the slack @njc-team.slack.com


### Prototypes update

## What didnt work
* was trying to organise a time to pop in to the NJC to pitch the 'map' idea to Kerry w/ Hieng, but it looks like he went ahead anyways, and it might be pivoting. He has asked to meet on wednesday so i'll see how that goes.

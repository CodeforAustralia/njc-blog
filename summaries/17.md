## What worked
### Prototypes update
* Electronic family violence order: working on integrating a test 'send by sms' link, the link will go on an admin page for the registry team to send a sms link to the clients. The interfaces were done this week, but ill integrate the sms function next week.
* Comms Dash: Caught up with Ann and Kerry about the dash, we think it might be better to keep it a bit more focused on 'projects' and 'team updates'
  - kerry liked the idea of integrating a way to pull in other staff to support you with something you post. ie as a staff, i post an update about a project I am working on and a 'call to action' for other staff to get involved, im a bit vague so i might look at pinning down some use cases to give this some focus
  - Kerry liked the bookmarklet form for entering the content
* NJC map - spent some time with Hieng trying to get some more details for this idea, I feel like its too vague, but im just going to have a stab at something and get back to him with it as a talking point

## What didnt work
* Reporting back didnt really happen as I had thought it might at the all staff session on the tuesday, the session ended up being a lot more personal, staff reflecting on their year and sharing some of their struggles. There wasn't much 'operational' talk, but that is ok.
* Need to get moving on additional prototypes for:
  - Online forms + policy document library
  - In/Outboard alternative, I need to probably do some mapping around what an ideal solution might look like and test that with Client services

## Blockers
* Preparing my user research report, not really too sure what I need to put in there.. so probably just gonna go with a pretty summary of 'what I have learned, what I did, whats coming up next and some possible opportunities I came across'
* Time - spent too much time on thinking about the report and preparing my presentataion for the DDT (digital designers toolbox)

## New findings
* Putting atomic design principles into practice
* i'm probably going to use meteorjs for something

## New people + others
* Everyone @ the DDT meetup

## Next week
* more prototypes!

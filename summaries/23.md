## What worked
* Co-design session with Gavin on:
 - TrakCare + Courtlink data integration (stop registry re-keyeing the same information between the 2 + give a 'clean' feed of upcoming cases)
 - We used POP to draw the prototype then link the pages togethor

## What didnt work

## Blockers

## New findings
* I had heard a bit about [POP](https://popapp.in/), but it was really good to actually use it, seems super useful

## New people + others

## Next week
* POP new in/out solution + test

## Follow up

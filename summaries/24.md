## What worked
* Showed the mock for the online guilty plea @ the leadership meeting, shows good promise, Magistrate fanning + Kerry + Damian + Eleanor (Fitzroy Legal) are interested in it
 - Planned out the next 2 weeks to prepare a working prototype to start testing with
* Added sms link functionality to Electronic access to documents, via Twilio - need to clean this up before meeting telstra on friday
* Spent ~1.5hrs with Ann + Maree on Thursday looking over the possible ideas for cards for Pausefest
 - I had added ~35 based on top pages in google Analytics
 - We looked at the proposed IA and picked out some good choices
 - Created some where we thought there were gaps based on Maree's (crime prevention) knowledge
* Followed up with Pene about some tools to support the monday family violence triaging - we had a chat a fortnight ago about some of the information that gets shared between the client services staff, currently this is all paper based.
 - TrakCare should be the authorative source, but not all staff have access and staff that do, tend to only add in 'sizeable' interactions / pieces of work. There is a hole, the triaging, support at court and offers for referrals arent all being captured
 - when pene was on leave, her replacement brendan, worked on an excel spreadsheet to help speed up the process, but it didnt continue past his time there
 - Looking at a simple interface to:
  + Add legal conflicts before the monday
  + Add interactions with clients on the monday
  + Search if a client has previously been assisted
  + Dump out all the data to fill in the TrakCare gaps
 - Met with Pene / Cameron / Anthony (new data/business analyst)   on thursday for ~30mins, the idea seems sound and we will flesh it out on tuesday
 - Currently the data exists in paper form, so it would be a good dataset to digitise

## What didnt work
* Setup my digital ocean droplet, just need to figure out how to move the apps across

## Blockers

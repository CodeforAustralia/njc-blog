## What worked
### Pausefest
* Finished preparing draft cards ready to test with staff, they were a mix of current IA, proposed IA from late last year and looking at top pages / searches from google analytics
* Ran a test session with staff using the draft cards on Tuesday after the staff meeting. This went well, had ~18 staff members stay and take part, they aded some areas I had missed with the cards, but more or less structured them roughly according to services / information about the NJC
* Reviewed the cards and updated them with new additions / rewording some of the phrases
* Prepared the 2nd task for the session (design a beta njc website)
* The Pausefest session was ok, there were roughly 20-25 participants, I used 70 cards and we had them split into 4 groups. Each group had a selection of personas, they were able to get through the activity in ~25mins, and we gave them 5-10mins at the end for the sketching activity. Some things I might have changed:
  - focus the sketch design on a new service that doesn't exist based on how the participants understand the personas
  - giving each group the same set of personas, not sure if it'd make much of a difference but id try it that way next time

### Family violence triaging
* Met with cameron / anthony / Pene re: a tool for the monday FV triaging. Looking into something simple that:
  - the case work counsellor to not have to send around printouts of the cases and have an online, up to date version
  - allows legal staff to add in conflicts for upcoming clients
  - registry to attach outcomes to a case
  - client services staff can add notes re: what kind of support was offered / given to a client

### Other
* Started the online guilty pleas interfaces

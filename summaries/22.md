## What worked
* I needed more detail on how appointments flow through the registry - spent some time with Damian going through how it works [Map of registry appointments](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4BAde5Ar3z6LVNVVE1Wak9pUnc)

## What didnt work
* Moving the NJC Map forward

## Blockers

## New findings
* Police can populate information into Courtlink, while going through appoinment scheduling / adjournments with Damian, he mentioned that in some cases they receive cases directly from police. Spoke with Brooke and she took us through the process. There seem to be systems on the Police end to allow them to do this, but it is not enforced - At least means that that are ways to get information into courtlink - could be useful
 - LEADER program - for FV related cases
 - Electronic initiation - criminal

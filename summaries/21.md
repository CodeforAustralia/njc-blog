## What worked
* Had coffee with Ri, talked a bit about what im doing, the work shes doing etc and bounced some ideas off her. It was good to hear kind
  of on the right track and to just get stuck into it.
*

## What didnt work
* i think the pausefest idea is good, but feels really nebulous, hopefully we can pin it down into something that will acutally be useful for the participants.

## Blockers

## New findings
* Protip for new fellows: don't delete any emails, probably useful stuff back there
* Going through the appointment scheduling from the registry perspective was interesting, learnt there were a few gaps i'd missed, need to do the same with client services.

## New people + others
* Phone conversation with Vanessa
 - updated her on progress so far, she suggested getting contact with InfoExchange re: some of the research they have done into disadvantaged people + service delivery
 - suggested an experiment she ran with Flipboard to help motivate staff around the importance of sharing information links etc and how it can be useful
* Meeting with ri - Data viz pro
* Popping into NJC to talk with Damian Friday morning

## Next week
* I think it would be good to have a bugherd account set up, get the NJC on that when they are using Prototypes / testing
* Chase up the progress of new web site - maybe civic lab to hack out possible ideas

## Follow up
* Set a date for that mid - late jan
* NJC slack
  - What are common things that NJC staff would be affected by -> make into channels
  - Talk to DOJ about what would be required to get this used in the NJC
  - Run proxy onto slack
* Honolulu answers (Watch the content)

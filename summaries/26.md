### website
* Compiled the pausefest results, looking pretty interesting.
* Tried to organise to meet with Ann to work on the next steps for the website, looks like this will be early next week instead, I don't want to wait too long on this

### Other
* Last week sent through high level overview of projects to Andy, he got back to me this week and said he wont have a chance to have a look until next week
* Last week started moving my projects into Trello and have invited NJC staff in there, seems to be working fine

## What didnt work
* Met with Alexar (from the cfa slack) from DHS (developer working with them) to find out a bit about what he is doing and if there is any potential crossover, it was interesting, but he didnt seem to know too much about what Code for Australia does in general, he seemed very interested in staying in touch and keeping up with the events / work we do, so that was positive.

## Blockers

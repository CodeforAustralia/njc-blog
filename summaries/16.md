## What worked
### Prototypes
Caught up with gavin and went through the prototype for online orders - went down quite well, it was perfect timing as I showed it to kerry right before the innovation fund event and she was excited enough by it show it off to anyone who was willing to listen. Kudos to gavin for suggesting we 'borrow' Kerry's phone to preload the form and link :).

### CST Prototyping session
Had some good feedback from Cameron re: the session on tuesday
* the format worked well
* having Alvaro as someone who isn't a knowledge expert helped keep it fresh
* staff enjoyed discussion that the ideas led to
* there seems to be some cross over with some other projects I'm looking into with other staff
* staff felt it was a bit vague at first, but they were getting the hang of it

## What didnt work
* Getting my metrics done
* Writing a blog post
* Managing time to have for Prototyping
* I tried to spend some with the crime prevention team to figure out what we can prototype for the 'NJC map' idea, but it was pretty hard to get them to move past thinking operationally and focus on the possible purpose of a map like this. We decided to focus it around issues, ie 'Helping women with agency in FV'

## Blockers
* Preparing this report

## New findings
* Matthew and Kylie have been trialing NJC mobile phones, cameron said this could be an option for all client services staff

## New people + others
* Sam Hannah Rankin - DPC
* Justin - portable studios
* Ben - The Age
* Jessica Enders - Formulate

## Next week
* Send out responses from workshop session to attendees + maybe circulate wider + create a typeform for feedback on the session?
* Update / report back on stakeholder engagement to NJC
* Chase up sub-domain with Chris (might need to call him)
* Is it worth running a similar version of last tuesdays session with registry + info team + kerry? (same issues etc)
* Connect with Brendan (replacing Pene as caseworker for FV from Co-Health) + figure out some possible areas to prototype
* I'm just wondering if I need a lunchtime update session for staff the following week before everyone disappears for christmas

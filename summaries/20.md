## What worked
* Spent time reviewing the current prototypes trying to figure out where things are at and how to possible move forward, need more help with this though
* Mapped out possible flows + basic user stories for:
  - [MyNJC](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4BAde5Ar3z6emZlUVFoZFdlMkU)
  - [In/Out board](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4BAde5Ar3z6LVNJek9ERlNPcHc)
  - [Intranet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4BAde5Ar3z6Vzg1OW9MYTNOUVk)
* Got in touch with Diane and she is organising some time for me to meet with the information team about the prototype I sent her for an intranet
* Sue will have the results ready next week for the surveying she was doing with the information team re: the types of queries they are getting at the desk

## What didnt work
* figuring out next steps for:
 - MyNJC (calendar appointment scheduling) -> maybe mock some of the touch points for clients and staff and just get testing i guess?
 - In/Out board (who is in the NJC today) -> probably going to mockup a dashboard to test?
 - NJC map: I really think I need data now to move this forward
 - Internal comms: on the last day last year I set up a slack for NJC and just not sure how to go about pitching for us to give it a trial - I kinda feel the perception will be 'another tool?' + we would need to get it unblocked on the DOJ network (at least within NJC). I assume convince Kerry -> Kerry can do whatever else needs to be done.

## Blockers
* Not too sure how to approach the next month, I think it will be important to have a 'fellowship' update before the end of the month
 - I think it would be good to be in the NJC 1 day a week for the next month and try and pack whatever I need to do in terms of catching up with staff / asking questions

## New findings
* The 18F methods cards seem to be a pretty good resource, that Im going to keep in the back of my pocket, its hard to say exactly which strategies will work at the NJC but either way i think it will be a nice toolkit and set of options to trial at different stages.

## New people + others
- Jurgen Schaub: Berry st
- Connected with Vanessa and will catch up with her later next week
- Will make contact ri: data-viz meetup - about preparing for data viz projects -> the NJC map

## Next week
* I think it would be good to have a bugherd account set up, get the NJC on that when they are using Prototypes / testing

# CST Session

## Statements

### In out board
Problem:
Staff don't have set schedules for every week, how can we check who is in the building or offsite at any time without having to call around, ask around or wander around the NJC.

Scenarios:
* How can I notify the rest of the staff at the NJC that I will be away tomorrow
* How can I

* How might we improve the in/outboard so we can send less emails
* How might we share the work we do with the rest of the NJC and our community
* How might we find out when our clients have arrived for their appointments
* How might we check our clients progress in between appointments

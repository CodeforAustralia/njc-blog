# Other Issues
* Possible centralised calendar
* Paper-based diary
* In/Out - difficult to manage who is the duty worker
  - Magistrate
  - Court
  - Good to know whos the duty worker - highlighted
  - Scheduling - putting in your leave and holidays etc
* Events database + multiple bookings - centralised (Alison)

# Intranet
## Current process
* JInfo / CSV content changes tool quickly
* Overarching policies for the whole of CSV
  - leave
  - harassment
  - perhaps link to external policies instead
* NJC specific
  - feedback policy
  - dealing with aggressive clients
  - client services brokerage policy (currently )
* CSV -> magistrate -> intranet

## Issues
* Currently look @ DOJ + CSV, so a third place to look?
* Background work required to update documents
* JInfo + CSV - difficult to navigate (Alison)
 - Tend to use search functions pretty heavily, lots of different sections
 - Content is still out of date
* You will have to still store it in G:?
  -  version history of the documents
* Policy review?
  - documents come from the DOJ / CSV sites
* Main problem (Diane) - policy, form and procedure are not aligned
* Minimal clicks
* DOJ / CSV
 - too big / complicated

## Possibilities
* Links between CSV / DOJ + NJC intranet
* Subscribing to different types of information?
* In/Out part of this?
* How to do your email?
* What are all these email lists?
* Up to date phone list?
* Would you break it down by each business unit?
* New staff of the week
 - printout + photo
* Induction portal
* In/Outboard
* People giving feedback on the fly
 - is this useful / valid information
* Other mag courts have something similar?
 - probably less so
 - everything goes through senior registrar

## Where to next
* Start small
* One stop shop
* Small prototype - to get going

## Sprint 1
* Form audit
* Staff re-imbursement form
* Seperate sections?
* Staff contact list + pictures of all the staff
* Documents
 - ordered
 - searchable
 - document history
* OHS information
 - Toolbox talk
 - Evac plan
 - Emergency contact

# Ann catchup

## Questions?
* Managing content moving forward + how is it currently done? (affects staff learning the new CMS etc)
* Did Boston.gov have a good idea of what they wanted when they started the process? Or are they moving with their users

## Website
* Ann:
  - Met web people from VLA: they are happy to mentor through the process
  - Wants to conduct a content audit
  - Will be looking at options for procurement
  - Is working on a report touching on: defining their identity, focus for the njc strategy + services
* Technology:
  - [drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) preference: CSV is using it
  - previously engaged company, but opted against going with them due to the NJCs preference for drupal
  - DOJ can possibly design / develop something, but more than likely with restrictions

* Current ideas:
  - Task focused
  - Incorporate information about Community Justice
  - Focused on court-related information / services (assumption is this is what people are mostly interested in)

## Pausefest aims
* Ann suggested it might be more important for this to be focused on the current website
* It would be good to cover IA and features -> maybe forget IA for now and the last step is for people to design an IA?

## Links for Ann
* [18F activities](http://njc.codeforaustralia.org/docs/18f-method-cards):
 - Affinity diagramming: this could be an activity the NJC staff do, we could survey clients about their NJC experience and then diagram to pick out common threads
 - Task flow analysis / journey mapping: We could do this on the personas to figure out a set of tasks and information needed for the website
 - Protosketch: this could be an option for driving an initial design / prototype, it would best be done with actual clients as well as staff
* [DTO service delivery standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/): overarching goals and approach
* [Service design and delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/): How they're doing it
* [DTO Design guides](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-guides/): good glossary of useful activities / tools / information
* GovDex
* [GovCMS](https://www.govcms.gov.au/)

## Possible activites we could run

* Pausefest:
  - Card sorting activity
  - Focused on the current website IA and content? | enough people -> then we could split and have some working on the proposed IA
  - Opportunity to look at what might be missing
* Look at current web stats and see what people are looking at / searching for
* Surveying clients experience:
  - Past / Current clients
  - Done in conjunction with Client services team
  - Short survey sent to clients after their interactions with the NJC
  - Get clients to sketch their experience of the njc / their last interaction
* Persona goals:
  - Try and define further the goals and aims of the personas the NJC has
  - Put the personas up in the NJC with prompts like: "How did you help me?", "What did I come to see you for?"
* Student labs:
  - Get the students to record what they are hearing from the clients they are working with
* Testing prototypes / mockups - Civic lab

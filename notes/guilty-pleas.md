# Guilty pleas
## Questions
* Gavin has examples of possible cases @ the NJC this could be applied to - also need to inquire at other mag courts too
* Check the letter for the order of the fields - date of offence first or date of case first? - assume people are following along on the letter
* do clients need to know progress of their plea after submitting or is the 7 day wait ok? - ask QLD
* Do registry know of any cases in the next week of clients who could have potentially plead guilty?

* Test with:
- Registry
- Clients
- Kerry

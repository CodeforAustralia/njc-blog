# Pausefest thoughts
## Background / Context
* [18F Cards](https://drive.google.com/a/codeforaustralia.org/file/d/0BzOvqdazE0qWMnFNQ3Rhd1dzMG8/view)
* [Current NJC Website](http://www.neighbourhoodjustice.vic.gov.au/)
* [Honolulu Answers](https://vimeo.com/43632898)
* This is how government services can be designed
* Government should work with their community and focus on what they need from you (not what you want to tell them)
* Focus on:
 - Services - What can we do for you?
 - Information - What do you need to know from us?

## Option 1
* 2 (or multiples of 2) groups, focused on either services or information
* KJ Method (18F): participants list individual priorities, we collect them, then group them by relationship and establish group priorities by up voting

## Option 2
* Split into groups - each group gets 1-2 sections of the website to look at
* Look at your section individually, get a feel for what it is about
* Summarise what it's trying to communicate
* List (maybe 5-10) most important points from it -> move to the next section
* Rewrite the points as a user needs. "I need to ..."
* As it progresses, someone collates the points being raised for each section and groups them by likeness

## Option 3
* Craft some personas of key website stakeholders
* Group participants and give each 1 persona
* Each group designs their own set of services and information - move onto the next persona
- this could work well, as the key audience will probably be familiar enough with user stories / personas to contribute effectively without knowing too many details of the 'client'

## Notes
* Maybe at the end, regardless we give everyone 5mins to sketch their ideal njc website?
* Might be worth doing a content audit + look at analytics data to get an idea of what people are currently looking at?
* Figure out deadline of when the site will be done

## Followup
* We can repeat the process with members of other groups
 - Uni / tafe students / researchers
 - Services that work with justice / courts -> Police, health, housing etc
 - other courts?
* Anyone want to be involved in further testing of the website

## Questions
* Do we have a rough idea of numbers? or the capacity of the room etc?
* Can we invite people from outside the NJC - CoY, past clients? partner agencies?, Other courts / DOJ staff?

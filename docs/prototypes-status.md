## MyNJC - client facing tools
### Electronic access to documents
Digitising and providing the option of online access to family violence and personal safety orders, and other court documents to NJC clients.
* Clients are given a paper copy of their court documents (in person or via mail)
* The NJC would like to give clients the option of online access to their documents to be able to access them at any time such as when an incident occurs and you need to convey the terms of your order to the police.
* Focusing on Family violence intervention and Personal safety orders (FVIO/PSO)

#### Status: In Progress
* Created a mobile [responsive prototype](http://njc-efv.herokuapp.com)
* [Prototyped](http://njc-efv.herokuapp.com/admin#/) how it can integrate into the current admin
* Next steps:
  - Demo with Court staff + Lawyers
  - Test with clients

### Calendar of appointments
Providing online access to a list of your upcoming appointments (with social workers) at the NJC and for court dates. Clients turn up for appointments, sometimes they don't have an appointment scheduled, the details have changed or they have the wrong date, the information team usually are the first contact and must call / email / search around to verify the meeting. Clients check in with the court registry when they arrive for their court date, social workers routinely check with the registry to see who has attended for the day.

* Provide a calendar of appointments for the information team to verify clients have an appointment with person X
* Access to the details of upcoming appointments and court dates
* Clients check-in when they arrive at the NJC - allow social workers to see who has attended, clients have a record that they attended
* Ability to reschedule appointments if you need to
* New appointment requests sent to your account and you can accept / propose a new time

#### Status: In Progress
* Mocking [interface for clients](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/ShWGM4yt7q/view/page/a0056ded4)
* [Mocking interface](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/ShWGM4yt7q/view/page/a298c2517) for list of appointments, who has attended and creating a new appointment
* Next steps:
  - Finish prototypes
  - Test with information team, registry, social workers
  - Test with clients

### Online guilty pleas
QLD have implemented [online guilty pleas](https://www.qld.gov.au/law/court/going-to-court/plead-guilty-online/#), this is something we could trial for the MCV

#### Status: Not started
* Damian looking into how QLD managed to do it
* Gavin looking into the technology they used

## Internal
### NJC Intranet
The NJC currently has no intranet for their documents, this is potentially an issue at other MCVs too.
* Documents are stored on a shared drive in folders
* CSV + MCV documents are sometimes linked to, or downloaded and stored on the shared drive
* Opportunity to centralise some other information: induction information, staff member contact lists, events, centre wide information

#### Status: In Progress
* Created [V1 mockups](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/view/page/a353dd477)
* Created [V1 prototype](http://njc-intranet.herokuapp.com/) - just click login
* Met with the information team - reviewed the prototype
* Created [V2 mockups](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/view/page/a4f966386)
* Working on V2 Prototype to test with Information team

### In / Out board
Staff send emails around each day to notify each other of changes in their work schedule (leaving early, going home sick, working from home), there is also a duty worker assigned each day. This is also sent around as an email. The information team have been trialling [inoutboard](https://www.inoutboard.com/) to reduce the number of these emails being sent and keep an eye on who is around, who is out and who might be on leave.

#### Status: Early progress
* Ran a session with client services staff to understand why they werent using in/out board + what could improve it
* Mocking a possible alternative to test
  - [See who is in / out](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/edit/page/ae4e92ceb)
  - [Update my in / out](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/edit/page/a6650e232)
  - [Set up a schedule for my regular hours](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/edit/page/acb56e560)
  - Integrate into the [NJC Intranet](#njc-intranet)

## Community / External
### NJC Website
The NJC are rebuilding their website, we are hoping to tie in some community engagement activities into the process to show how you can involve your clients and community in government projects.

#### Status: Early progress
* [Pausefest session](/docs/pausefest-session) on card sorting current NJC website content

### NJC Map
The NJC want to show how community justice can work, and the work that has been done in the City of Yarra. The focus will be on the partnerships between different social agencies and how they collaborate.

#### Status: Early progress
* [Mocked prototype](https://app.moqups.com/ekigbo/5ZBPPdq0mn/view/page/a1c9a6a86)
* Next steps:
  - Gather sample data
  - Produce working demo - demo around to get other agencies on board to contribute data

# Pausefest - February, 13 2016

## Goals:
* "Rebuilding Citizenship in the 21st Century."
* Starting point for a series of community focused activities to help with the re-development of the NJC website
* Test the existing website content with community
* Generate a possible IA from the NJCs current content
* Highlight some important services and information
* Identify some areas that might be missing

## Session
1. Intro / Background to the NJC + Code for Australia (15mins)
2. Card sort activity (20mins)
3. Clustering the cards (5mins) - which of these do you feel go togethor? What would you label them as?
4. Reframe clusters as a question (5mins)
5. Organize cards into a hierarchy (5mins) - Are any clusters more important than any others?

Depending on how many participants we have we could split into multiple groups for this and have one (or more) groups look at the proposed IA.

Participants would also have blank cards to add anything they think might be missing.

## Preparation
We will need to define a series of cards, these could be a mixture of statements, services, information from the existing website content.

We could also ask NJC staff to contribute what they think the website should convey and add those to the mix of cards.

## Post-Pausefest
Some other activities we could run after pausefest, perhaps with Civic lab, internally with NJC staff / partners or with clients:

* Content Audit (I think Ann has got this covered?)
* Web analytics  - Look at current web stats and see what people are looking at / searching for
* Surveying clients experience:
  - Past / Current clients
  - Done in conjunction with Client services team
  - Short survey sent to clients after their interactions with the NJC
  - Get clients to sketch their experience of the njc / their last interaction
* Persona goals:
  - Try and define further the goals and aims of the personas the NJC has
  - Put the personas up in the NJC with prompts like: "How did you help me?", "What did I come to see you for?"

* [18F activities](http://njc.codeforaustralia.org/docs/18f-method-cards):
 - Affinity diagramming: this could be an activity the NJC staff do, we could survey clients about their NJC experience and then diagram to pick out common threads
 - Task flow analysis / journey mapping: We could do this on the personas to figure out a set of tasks and information needed for the website
 - Protosketch: this could be an option for driving an initial design / prototype, it would best be done with actual clients as well as staff

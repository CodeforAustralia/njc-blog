## Discover phase
### Cognitive walk through
An evaluation method in which evaluators or potential users who are un-familliar with a design work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the tasks as they go.

To understand whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isnt easy.

1. Identify specific traits for new users or infrequent users of a design solution
2. Develop a set of representative tasks that emphasize new use or infrequent use
3. Recruit 3 to 5 users for each of the traits you've identified to participate in a moderated usability testing session. The traits can overlap.
4. Ask the user to accomplish their goal using a printed or interactive design, as they go, ask what they would attempt to do next or how they would learn
- dont lead the user through the task, but encourage them to stay focused on what they're trying to accomplish.
- Pay attention to expected outcomes and how quickly/easily participants are able to pick up a task.
5. Analyze the walkthrough results to highlight what users learned easily and what needs improvement.

### Metrics definition
A collaborative effort to define problems through a focus on goals and the criteria by which a team will measure a solution's impact on those problems.

To keep the team vigilant about the user's perspective and to establish a user-centered framework for passively measuring over time. Research keeps us vigilant about building metrics that emphasize the user's perspective rather than metrics that make us appear good at our jobs.

1. Describe the existing situation to the team, including who the stakeholders are and what their stake is.
2. Use personas to identify user's skills, practices and behaviours. Decide which you want to promote and how you would measure that. Next look at persona's pain points and consider how you would alleviate them (and how you would measure that)
3. Anonymously collect the teams greatest hopes and fears. Print these out group them by topic, and discuss. Think about how you can measure throughout the project, whether its aligning with your collective hopes or deviating towards you fears.
4. Craft a problem statement:
> We have observed that [product/service/organization] isnt meeting these [goals/needs] which is causing [this adverse effect], How might we improve so that our team/organization is more successful based on these [measurable criteria]?

### Feature dot voting
A simple voting exercise to identify a group's collective priorities for potential features or user stories.

To build group consensus quickly from the priorities of individual in the group.

1. Bring post it notes and glue dots
2. Gather all people on the product team and anyone with a stake in the product's features
3. Quickly review the projects goals and conclusions of any prior research
4. Ask team members to take five minutes to write important features or user needs on sticky notes (1 feature per sticky)
5. After 5mins ask participants to put their stickies on a board. IF there are many sticky notes, ask participants to put their features next to similar ones, remove exact duplicates.
6. Give participants 3-5 glue dots and instruct them to place their dots on features they feel are most important to meeting project goals and user needs.
7. Identify the features with the largest number of votes

## Decide Stage
### Mental modelling
A simple reference model that correlates existing and potential interfaces with user behaviours.

To help designers anticipate how design decisions might facilitate future behaviours.

1. Create one three columned table per persona. Label the columns Past, Present Behaviour, Future.
2. In the middle column (present behaviour), list current user behaviours and pain points broadly related to the project one per row.
3. In the left-hand column (past), list the products, services, features and or interfaces that the user encounters as they go about whats listed in the present behaviours column.
4. In the right hand column list possible products, services, features and or interface elements that might change behaviours and pain points in the present behaviours column in the future.

### Affinity diagramming
A way of finding themes in collections of ideas, quotes or observations.

Quick and collaborative approach for drawing insights from qualitative data.

1. Record ideas, quotes or observations from interviews, contextual inquiry and other sources of research on post it notes.
2. Place the post it notes on a whiteboard in no particular arrangement, move the post it notes into related groups.
3. Use larger post it notes or whiteboard markers to write titles or catch phrases for each group.

### Task flow analysis
A step-by-step analysis of a common task a user must perform that diagrams various touch points and decision points a user goes through to accomplish the task. The touch points should be represented as steps taken by the user, as well as steps taken by the system.

To illustrate in a solution agnostic way the overall flow that user progresses through to accomplish a single task. Task flow analysis also demonstrates the relationship between tasks, and how they interconnect across a site.

1. Identify the task(s) that need to analysed
2. Break each high level task down into the subtasks and decisions that the user or system must perform. Specify the subtask in terms of objectives. Across all subtasks, you should cover the whole area of interest. Dont make assumptions about which steps are understood.
3. Produce a layered task diagram of each subtask and decision point. The diagram must cover each step or decision necessary to accomplish the task.
4. Annotate the layered task diagram to pinpoint areas of interest, risk or potential frustration.
5. Present the analysis to a potential user or stakeholder who was not involved in creating the diagram(s) but who knows the task(s) well enough to check for consistency and accuracy.

### Comparative analysis
A detailed review of existing experiences provided either by direct competitors or related agencies or services.

To identify competitors solutions that excel, are lacking, or a missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can give new solutions a competitive edge by identifying areas of opportunity, gaps in experience offerings and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid.

1. Identify a list of services or agencies that would be either direct or related competitors to the service or client agency. Pare the list down to four or five.
2. Establish which heuristics you will use to evaluate each service or agency offering.
3. Break down the analysis of each selected competitor into specific focal areas for evaluation. For example, how relevant are search results?
4. Use a spreadsheet to capture the evaluation and determine how the targeted services and agencies perform based on the identified heuristics.
5. Present the analysis, which should showcase areas of opportunities that you can take advantage of and design patterns you might adopt or avoid.

### Journey mapping
A visualisation of the major interactions shaping a user's experience of a product or service.

To provide design teams with a birds-eye view of a design system, helping them see the, order, complexity, successes, pain points and interactions that make up a users experience.

1. Document the elements of the projects design context
 * People invovled and their related goals
 * Their behaviours in pursuit of their goals
 * Information, devices and services that support their behaviours
 * Discrete moments or major decisions they make
 * The emotions associated with these moments or decisions
2. Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviours, use information, make decisions and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of phases related to the personal narrative of each persona. Identify where personas share contextual components.
3. Discuss th emap with stakeholders, point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish design principles. Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customers journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the projects scope.
4. You can also map user journesy as part of a workshop with stakeholders, similar to a design studio.

### User scenarios
Stories and context - focused on identifying the what, who, how and why - behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.

To remind a team, during both the design and validation phases of the overarching goal(s) that users have when interacting with a solution. Scenarios help the team consider the design of the solution as a whole rather than getting caught up by specific pages, elements or interactions. They note questions and goals and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them.

1. Identify the target user group and any common user goals and scenarios that a person must go through when interacting with a solution.
2. Decide which type of scenario you're going to write.
	* Goal or task-based, short and specific, focus on the core aspects of the goal or task
	* Elaborate, provide additional details about the environment and context.
	* Full-Scale, include various steps a user needs to take as well as their environment and context
3. Describe why its important for a user to be able to accomplish their goal or complete the scenario
4. Share with the full team for feedback and refinement
5. If you want to use the scenarios for usability testing, write them so they do not lead the participant to the correct outcome.

## Make
### Protosketching
A prototype built in fewer than 3 hours to focus the scope of a project.

To stimulate stakeholder imaginations and focus discussion on issues about data, design and functionality.

1. Gather project stakeholders and most importantly a small number of end users. This should be few enough that all participants can contribute individually.
2. While one team member leads a discussion o project goals and possible solutions another starts "proto-sketching" or building a very basic version of an app or website.
3. As the protosketch acquires enough features to be usable, share it with the meeting attendees. If possible, let them access it on their own devices.
4. Use the prototype to elicit discussion of features and data. As the discussion continues, the protosketcher continues to roughly integrate some suggested features.
5. As the meeting closes, emphasise that the protosketch isn't necessarily the start of production-ready software, but a way to improve discussion about project requirements.

### Case Triage
One of the strengths of the NJC is the wholistic approach taken to supporting their clients. Client services is mostly composed of staff from various service providers within the City of Yarra, specialising in a vast array of different areas such as drug and alchohol counselling, family violence support, financial and housing support among others. This is particularily showcased in the NJC's approach to family violence matters.

Family violence matters are all heard on the same day, in the week prior to the hearings, staff prepare background information on each of the members in the matter. This allows each of the service providers to not only share any information they might have that could be beneficial to the client, but also for the staff to assess what kind of situation the client is and which services might be appropriate to provide support for the client on the day. This whole process comes in contact with most of the services within the NJC included the legal staff, court registry and most of the service providers. Prior to the matters being heard, all the service providers meet to go through the cases togethor update any new information and decide on which services should be assigned to which clients. Throughout the day staff update each other on the progress of the matters they have been assigned where necessary.

This process is mostly manual with highlighted sheets of paper passed around to communicate a range of information, additionally it is difficult to look back through the history of records for information on the outcomes of a matter and of the different support that was provided from the services, some of the information is recorded on the NJC's case management tool, mostly information about referrals made for a client, but there was a definite gap of information that is not recorded that really captures the full scale of the support the NJC staff provide to their clients.

The case triage dashboard provides an opportunity for all the staff involved in the family violence cases to:

* Assign services to provide support for a client
* Track which services met with a client and what support was offered
* Search a history of all the cases that have been entered and view any relevant outcomes + services provided
* Enter outcomes from a hearing for each case
* Update cases with a legal conflict, allowing the registry to plan which cases might require an alternative legal provider
* Export all the data for quantitative analysis
* Update client information like name and date of birth when not available from the court listing

This prototype was able to give use enough information about how a tool like this could be useful, we could test it within a small group of the NJC service providers without disrutping their day to day work and start to explore where the areas of improvement would be.

The next steps required would be for a proper pilot test to be conducted for at least a month, the pilot would be an opportunity to trial completely replacing the paper process, retaining the paper as a backup and thoroughly testing not only how useful the tool is for all the services included but also delve into any of the edge cases we might have missed.

One of the major limitations of the current prototype is the lack of integration with the courts case system, this proved to be a constant point of blockage during the fellowship so we opted to manually enter the cases each week when they are available. This is a far from ideal solution and adds uneeded overhead to the process, the ideal solution would be a direct feed from the courts system to populate the list of cases for the next week, removing the need for manual entry and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Other areas for further improvement include:

* Integration with other NJC and courts systems to share information
* Expanding the reporting and data available
* User experience testing

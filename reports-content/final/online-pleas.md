### Online Pleas
Online pleas progressed the furthest out of all the prototypes, we developed a simple prototype to allow individuals to submit a guilty plea for minor infringements online. The prototype demonstrates how a guilty plea could be lodged online prior to the scheduled court date for non-complex minor offences - typically these offences comprise nearly 50% of MCVâ€™s (Magistrates Court Victoria) case volume.

The prototype was developed to be a simple online form that would allow clients to fill in some simple information about who they are, the offence that they are choosing to plead guilty to and a message to the magistrate. The message to the magistrate might include explaining why you offended, your personal or financial circumstances, and things you would like the magistrate to consider when deciding your sentence. The form also includes declarations from the client acknowledging that they have the option to plead guilty or not guilty to the offences and that the plea is entered voluntarily of their own will. Once the form is completed, a copy is formatted and sent to the registry ready to be processed by the magistrate.

A lot of investigation and changes were required along the way, initially we had hoped clients could simply enter an offence number which would identify their case but because of the different systems used between police and the courts, this could not be easily established. Types of offences that were too complicated or had the potential to slow down progress were removed altogethor. Additionally we spent time understanding how to communicate this service to clients of the court, how the registry could quickly identify the relevant cases and include the right information in the summons.

This prototype is now ready for a pilot test with real world users, the pilot test should be an opportunity to gain feedback and research from real court clients, it should provide further insight in the likelihood of court

Further improvements needed after the pilot include:
* Planning for multiple sites - the current prototype is NJC specific
* Integration with the courts systems to identify upcoming matters that might be eligible
* Workflow for registry staff to simplify identifying potential matters, notifying the clients of the option and updating the court records
* The ability to have a standardised offence number which could be used to identify the matter
* Thorough review of the types of cases that could be included
* User experience research and testing

## Prototypes
### Electronic access to documents (Prototype)
One of the first areas of exploration was around access to court documents, currently documents such as court dates, summons and intervention orders are printed and either physically handed to clients or sent by mail. We decided to focus on was Personal safety and Family violence intervention orders. These are legal documents with specific terms used to outline the conditions of the order, respondents are expected to understand the terms of the order to ensure they can avoid a breach, and affected members are also required to understand them in the event that a breach does occur and police or other authorities need to be notified.

We wanted to provide a simple, accessible option for clients to have easy access to an up to date copy of this order. In the event of the terms of the order changing, we wanted clients to be able to access the most up to date information whenever they needed it.

A mobile [responsive prototype](http://njc-efv.herokuapp.com) to illustrate how this might work from the clients perspective. We also explored how this might be implemented into a broader project for online family violence intervention orders which the NJC had started to explore. This prototype was well received and will be incorporated into a future project.

### Calendar of appointments (Mockups / additional research)
We saw a good opportunity for providing online access to a list of upcoming appointments, both for NJC clients and staff. Clients turn up for appointments, sometimes they don't have an appointment scheduled, the details have changed or they have the wrong date, the information team usually are the first contact and must call / email / search around to verify the meeting. Clients check in with the court registry when they arrive for their court date, social workers routinely check with the registry to see who has attended for the day.

* Provide a calendar of appointments for the information team to verify clients have an appointment with a staff member
* Access to the details of upcoming appointments and court dates
* Clients check-in when they arrive at the NJC - allow client services staff to see who has attended
* Clients have a record that they attended
* Ability to reschedule appointments if you need to
* New appointment requests sent to clients with and option to accept / propose a new time that might be more appropriate

Mockups and a process map were produced after some additional user interviews to better understand how this solution might look and how it could be integrated into the work the NJC staff.

Additionally it would be useful to keep an eye on the work being done by DTO on an [appointment booking tool for citizenship](https://github.com/AusDTO/citizenship-appointment-client).

### NJC Website (Additional research)
The NJC had begun exploring what a new website might look like for them, so we spent some time conducting some additional research to help prepare for this project. Some preliminary work had been conducted on a possible Information Architecture, so we decided to explore what it might mean to try and test that with a wider audience.

We held a workshop at the [2016 Pausefest](www.codeforaustralia.org/blog/pausefest-2016-re-building-a-government-website) conference with participants so we could try to possibly:

* Identify some areas that might be missing from the current website and IA
* Generate a possible IA from the NJCs current content
* Protosketch ideal solutions for a NJC service or a new website

The results of this session along with an internal session held with staff for the same IA and a deeper look at some analytics data provided some new perspectives and possible ideas for the new NJC website which will be continued by the NJC.

### Staff in / out (Mockups / prototype)
Staff send emails around each day to notify each other of changes in their work schedule (leaving early, going home sick, working from home), additionally a duty worker is assigned each day to provide frontline assessment of clients, this information is sent around by the staff member assigned to the role. to reduce the number of these emails being sent and keep an  eye on who is around, who is out and who might be on leave. Being the first contact for the any visitor to the centre, the information team are often tasked with tracking down the relevant staff members.

A session was held with staff to dive deeper into what an ideal solution for the NJC might look like, mockups were then produced and a prototype of this was eventually incorporated into the intranet project, along with a general, searchable listing of staff contact details.

### NJC Map (Mockups / research)
The NJC were interested in finding ways to visualise how community justice can work, in particular what has worked within the City of Yarra, focusing on the partnerships between the different service providers in the community and how they have collaborated and contributed to tackling some of the more complex issues in the city. Additionally the map could also prove to be a starting point with service providers the NJC had not previously engaged with, or to help share the knowledge held within the community.

We decided to take the approach of focusing on cases studies in the area, coupled with quantitative data. Mockups were produced over a few iterations to highlight how this might all come togethor.

More research is required to find the kind of case studies and datasets that would be required for this project, the most important step would be to start engaging with local service providers and gauge what information is currently available, or could be pieced togethor to tell a story. Additionally, as this should also be a tool to help 'tell the story' of community justice in the City of Yarra, further research is needed to decide on the appropriate mediums to convey this information. The mockups focused on a web-based interface, but it could be a good opportunity to start exploring other technology such as touchscreen interfaces or augmented reality.

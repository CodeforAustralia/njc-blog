## Research
During my research period, my time was spent trying to get a better understanding of who the NJC are and what they do. I spent roughly 60 days working at the NJC getting involved in the day to day by:
- Shadowing staff across all different areas of the NJC in their work
- Observing the different types of court cases seen at the NJC
- Attending meetings both on-site and in the community with staff members and sitting in on appointments with clients
- And by asking lots and lots of questions

What I wanted to understand from this was:
- their context - why they exist, what do they do, who do they work with and how do they do this
- their constraints - technical, resourcing and administrative constraints
- their pain points - this included the pain points that I observed, processes I noticed could be improved by some simple technology and issues staff were telling me about
- previous solutions and upcoming projects - what were some of the solutions that had been previously tried to alleviate some of the pain points, I didnt want to recreate solutions that had already been tried and tested.

After the research stage, we had a range of pain points of that were ready for further exploration. Solutions were then prototyped at different levels to allow us to start exploring the soundness of the solution, complexity of implementing the solution and any areas that would require further research to properly define the problem to be tackled.

The prototyping stage was spent working with a range of staff within the njc, an iterative approach was taken to all prototypes focusing on regular feedback from stakeholders and regular updates on progress. While the majority of the time was spent working from our Code for Australia offices, regular meetings were scheduled with key stakeholders to update on progress, highlight and address any issues that have arisen and to plan the next steps for each prototype.

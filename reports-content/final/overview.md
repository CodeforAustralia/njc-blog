## Overview
My year as a fellow has been nothing short of interesting, I've enjoyed having the opportunity to work with the Neighbourhood Justice Centre, exploring what community justice means and how it can be realised.

I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was looking for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for small businesses and startups togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help government deliver solutions for its citizens that meets their needs and reduce the frustration of dealing with government services.

The fellowship has given me the opportunity to work with a diverse range of people passionate about the work they do for the community, it's given me the chance to apply my technical and analytical skills in a domain outside my understanding and also explore a variety of projects.

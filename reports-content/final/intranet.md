### Intranet
This prototype was mostly the result of a series of earlier prototypes around improving internal communications, staff updates and knowledge sharing at the NJC. A large group of the NJC staff are employed by external service providers but they work within the centre for the majority of their week, this results in an environment where different staff have different levels of access to information, tools and software necessary for their day to day work, additionally staff regularly work in the community outside the centre on varying schedules making it difficult to know is currently available in the centre. The prototype provided an opportunity to envision what an intranet for a magistrates court could look like, it provided an opportunity to explore what kind of features could be useful for staff in their day to day work and also help improve the communication and knowledge sharing between the different teams.

We focused on document and information (news, events) management and a central staff listing with , this was one of the key areas of interest.

We were able to develop a working prototype to provide a central location for:

- Managing links to all documents, policies, procedures and forms
- Quick access to contact details for the current duty worker
- Sharing news and upcoming events
- Staff in and out status
- Integrated search across staff contact details, documents, news and events
- An opportunity for staff to provide feedback for improvement

While the prototype worked well enough as a mechanism to gather feedback from the different teams within the NJC to help shape how a tool like this could be used, there was definately room for further improvement and development. This requires more user research, the pain points it currently addressed were really more of the 'obvious' use cases, but there would be more potential for this be something that is embedded deeply into how the NJC shares information and knowledge internally.

Some of the features that were discussed but not implemented included:
* Library of information research staff come across relating to community justice
* Utilising existing tools from MCV for hosting and development of the intranet
* The ability to view previous versions of a document

Particularly the staff in and out board, this could be pursued as a standalone solution to help communicate who is currently at the NJC and who the duty worker for the day is, further work would need to be done to:

* Investigate options for updating your status to reduce friction for users ie email a specific inbox, saving a bookmarklet, webapp
* Sending prompts and reminders for staff to update their status
* Integration with any appointment management tool

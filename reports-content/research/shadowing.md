## What have i done
Before I started, some of my goals for this research stage were to:
* Gain a deep understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand who makes up the NJC's community, how, why and when they interact with the NJC
* Capture possible opportunities and ideas that could form the basis for prototypes

My time researching at the NJC has has been a mixture of shadowing staff in their various roles, mapping, reading, listening, hearing and documenting whatever I can about the background and the context the NJC operates in, sitting in on various community events and networks and getting immersed in discussions about how community Justice is done at the NJC.

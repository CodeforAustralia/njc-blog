## Pie in the sky
Through discussions with staff members, the community and anyone else who would lend me their ears, as well as learning more about the City of Yarra, we often came to areas of discussion that seem like great opportunities for the NJC to innovate not just through technology but also through deeper engagement with their community.

* Providing a platform to connect local like-minded people and companies with real world issues and communities
* Increasing the ability of the NJC to be at the centre of leading edge justice
* Growing the NJC as an education leader in delivery of client-focused justice
* Continually sharing the successes and small wins, talking about the day to day changes and impact the NJC is having in the lives of the community
